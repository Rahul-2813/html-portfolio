<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Everybody I am Rahul Parihar and I am a government employee who wants to explore new things everyday, I was very fond of government job but when 
  joined one then only I came to know that government jobs are not worth it becasuse simply they are monotonous you 
  never learn any skills in such jobs , So i decided to learn programming because i was very fond of it in my school days So i took the udemy course by Dr. Angela you
and i found it very useful.</p>

<p>I would like to tell you that i have learned web page development from the scratch and I can help you build websites as you would like at very reasonable prices.</p>
